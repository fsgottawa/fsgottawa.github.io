Want to get involved with FSG? We're always looking for volunteers to help in two key ways:

**Workshop Volunteer**

Workshops are major part of FSG meetings. Have something you want to share? We've had workshops ranging from managing finances to bee-keeping, from cognative behavioral therapy to 3-D printing. If there's something you're passionate, we would love to hear your idea!

**Weekly Meeting Volunteer**

Volunteers at our weekly group meetings are key to running FSG. Volunteers at the weekly meeting get to know and connect with FSG attendees, creating an environment where everyone feels welcome.

*Sound like something for you?*
