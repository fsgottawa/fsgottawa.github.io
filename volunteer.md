**Interested in volunteering?**

Want to get involved with FSG? We're always looking for volunteers to help in two key ways:

**Workshop volunteer **

Workshops are key activity at FSG meetings. Have something you want to share? We've had workshops ranging form --- to --- so if there's something you're passionate about send us a message at -----. We would love to hear your idea!

**Weekly meeting**

Volunteers at our weekly group meetings are key to running FSG. Volunteers at the weekly meeting get to know and connect with FSG attendees, creating an environment where everyone feels welcome.
